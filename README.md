# hello-world
there lived a certain man, in russia long ago, he was big and strong in his eyes a flaming glow. most people looked at him, w/ terror &amp; w/ fear - but to moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear. he could preach the bible like a preacher full of escatsy and fire, but he also was the kind of teacher women would desire. ra ra rasputin, lover of the russian queen, there was a cat that really was gone.
